      description: "Choose your search criteria carefully. Availability is an expensive

        do so for a single date. If you decide to search availability for multiple
        dates you should only do so\r\nfor a specific resource by specifying the optional
        resourceId parameter.\r\n\r\nStart and End times are specified as military
        times e.g. 800 = 8:00am, 2230 = 10:30pm. \r\nYou will only see availability
        within the boundary of your business start and end times.\r\n\r\ndayAvailability
        will return day availablility for the number of days requested from the start
        date.\r\n\r\nfirstDayAvailable only works with day availability. If set to
        true it will look for the first day available within the range specified\r\nby
        the dayAvailability parameter. The two parameters together can be a clever
        way to display availability for a week or month.\r\nTip - pass in the beginning
        of the week or month, and available times are displayed for the first available
        date if exists.\r\n\r\nYou should only specify the duration parameter if you
        let your customers choose the duration of the appointment. e.g. from a list.\r\n\r\nThe
        tz parameter allows you to select a suitable timezone for the customer to
        book in. Your app should be timezone aware if you \r\nuse this option. The
        requested timezone is specified as an offset(plus or minus) from GMT time."
